# Nozzle Library - Production Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary

The nozzle library implements an interesting alternative to the circuit breaker pattern, gradually adjusting flow rates rather than using binary on/off states. While the core concept is sound and performance is excellent (0 allocations, 95.2% test coverage), several critical issues prevent it from being production-ready.

## Critical Issues (P0 - Must Fix)

### 1. Goroutine Leak ✅ FIXED
**Location**: `nozzle.go:165-169`
```go
func (n *Nozzle[T]) tick() {
    for range time.Tick(n.Options.Interval) {
        n.calculate()
    }
}
```
**Problem**: 
- Goroutine runs forever with no cleanup mechanism
- `time.Tick()` creates a channel that can't be stopped
- No way to gracefully shutdown the nozzle

**Impact**: Memory leak in production systems, especially when creating/destroying many nozzles

**Fix Implemented**:
- ✅ Added `Close()` method to stop the ticker
- ✅ Used `time.NewTicker()` with proper cleanup
- ✅ Added done channel for graceful shutdown
- ✅ Implemented idempotent Close() using sync.Once
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for goroutine leak detection
- ✅ Updated all examples to show proper cleanup pattern
- ✅ Updated README with cleanup documentation
- ✅ Nozzle now implements io.Closer interface

### 2. Race Condition in OnStateChange Callback
**Location**: `nozzle.go:321-328`
```go
if changed && n.Options.OnStateChange != nil {
    // Need to unlock so OnStateChange can call public methods.
    n.mut.Unlock()
    n.Options.OnStateChange(n)
    n.mut.Lock()
}
```
**Problem**:
- Mutex is unlocked during callback execution
- State can be modified by other goroutines during callback
- Callback might see inconsistent state

**Impact**: Data races, inconsistent behavior, potential panics

**Fix Required**:
- Clone state before callback
- Use separate mutex for callback
- Pass immutable snapshot to callback

### 3. Integer Overflow Risk
**Location**: `nozzle.go:349` and `nozzle.go:365`
```go
n.decreaseBy = (mult * 2)  // Exponential growth without bounds
```
**Problem**:
- `decreaseBy` grows exponentially without upper bound
- Can overflow int64 after ~63 doublings
- No bounds checking on multiplication

**Impact**: Panic or incorrect behavior when overflow occurs

**Fix Required**:
- Add maximum cap for decreaseBy
- Check for overflow before multiplication
- Use safe multiplication with bounds checking

### 4. Incorrect Allow Rate Calculation
**Location**: `nozzle.go:198` and `nozzle.go:258`
```go
if n.allowed != 0 {
    allowRate = int64((float64(n.allowed) / float64(n.allowed+n.blocked)) * 100)
}
```
**Problem**:
- Uses cumulative counters since last reset
- Should use per-interval statistics
- Rate becomes increasingly inaccurate over time

**Impact**: Incorrect throttling decisions, deviation from intended flow rate

**Fix Required**:
- Track per-interval statistics separately
- Calculate rate based on current interval only
- Reset counters properly

## Functional Gaps (P1 - Important)

### 5. Missing Context Support
**Problem**: No way to cancel operations or respect timeouts
**Impact**: Can't integrate with context-aware systems, no timeout support

**Required Changes**:
```go
DoErrorContext(ctx context.Context, callback func() (T, error)) (T, error)
DoBoolContext(ctx context.Context, callback func() (T, bool)) (T, bool)
```

### 6. Limited Error Handling
**Current State**: Only returns `ErrBlocked`
**Problem**: Can't distinguish between different failure types

**Required Improvements**:
- Add error types for different scenarios
- Provide diagnostic information in errors
- Support error wrapping

### 7. No Metrics Integration
**Problem**: No hooks for monitoring systems
**Impact**: Can't observe nozzle behavior in production

**Required Features**:
- Prometheus metrics interface
- OpenTelemetry support
- Custom metrics collector interface

## Code Quality Issues (P2 - Nice to Have)

### 8. Missing Configuration Validation
**Problem**: No validation of Options on creation
**Impact**: Runtime failures with invalid configuration

**Improvements Needed**:
- Validate Interval > 0
- Validate AllowedFailurePercent in [0, 100]
- Provide sensible defaults

### 9. Insufficient Edge Case Testing
**Missing Test Coverage**:
- Goroutine leak detection
- Integer overflow scenarios
- Concurrent state modifications
- Long-running stability tests

### 10. Documentation Gaps
**Missing Documentation**:
- Migration guide from circuit breakers
- Performance tuning guide
- Best practices for production use
- Comparison with other patterns

```

### Performance Regression Prevention
- Maintain 0 allocation guarantee
- Keep sub-microsecond operation latency
- Benchmark after each change

## Success Criteria

- [x] No goroutine leaks ✅ FIXED
- [ ] No race conditions (verified with -race)
- [ ] No integer overflows
- [ ] Accurate rate calculations
- [x] Graceful shutdown support ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Recommended for Production
- [ ] Context support
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Metrics integration
- [ ] 100% test coverage
- [ ] Stress tested for 24+ hours

## Alternative Approaches to Consider

### 1. Token Bucket Algorithm
Instead of percentage-based flow rate, use token bucket for more predictable behavior.

### 2. Adaptive Window Sizing
Dynamically adjust the interval based on traffic patterns.

### 3. Multi-Level Nozzles
Support different flow rates for different priority levels.

## Conclusion

The nozzle library has an innovative approach and excellent performance characteristics. However, it requires significant work to be production-ready. The critical issues (P0) must be addressed before any production use. The functional gaps (P1) are important for real-world applications but could be added incrementally.

**Recommendation**: Fix P0 issues first, then evaluate if the pattern provides sufficient value over traditional circuit breakers to justify the additional complexity.
