The Hose Nozzle Pattern

## What?

Imagine these two control devices in your home:

1. A Light Switch
2. A Hose Nozzle

A light switch (generally) has two modes: off and on. A hose nozzle has many positions between fully off and fully on.

Just for fun: If you had a hose nozzle with infinite precision, there would be infinite steps between fully off and fully on.
